# Stash Marker Studio v3.0 Plan

## Overview

Transform Stash Marker Studio from a lightweight companion app into a full-featured marker management system with its own PostgreSQL database, while maintaining Stashapp as the primary source of truth for core entities (scenes, performers, tags).

## Problem Statement

Current limitations:
- Stashapp player performance degrades with 100+ markers per scene
- No support for rich marker metadata beyond basic tags
- No way to link performers to specific markers (e.g., "who is wearing this dress?")
- Limited workflow support for AI-generated metadata
- No storage for AI analysis results (camera movement detection, YOLO scene/object detection)
- Slow marker searches and filtering

## Architecture Vision

### Data Layer Strategy

**Stashapp remains source of truth for:**
- Scenes (video files, metadata, basic info)
- Performers (identity, attributes)
- Tags (taxonomy, hierarchy)
- Studios, galleries, images

**New PostgreSQL database stores:**
- Extended marker data with rich metadata
- Marker slots and performer associations
- AI analysis results (camera movement, YOLO detections, etc.)
- PySceneDetect shot boundaries (keep these out of Stashapp)
- Marker search index for fast filtering
- Audit trail for marker changes
- Export status tracking (which markers synced to Stashapp)

**Synchronization model:**
- Manual import: Button to import markers from Stashapp to local DB (one-way)
- Selective export: Choose which markers to push to Stashapp (one-way)
- No automated sync: User controls when to import/export via UI buttons
- Rich metadata (slots, AI results) stays in local DB only
- Stashapp scene/performer/tag IDs stored in local DB for referential integrity

### Database Schema Design

#### Schema Philosophy

The schema uses a **hybrid approach** for marker and tag storage:

1. **Core tables mirror Stashapp's structure** (`markers`, `marker_tags`) - This ensures clean bidirectional sync by keeping field names and semantics aligned with Stashapp's GraphQL API
2. **Extension tables add rich metadata** (`marker_metadata`, `marker_slots`, etc.) - These are completely independent and never exported to Stashapp
3. **Sync tracking at marker level** - `last_synced_at` and `last_exported_at` on the `markers` table track when the entire marker (including all tags) was synced/exported, eliminating the need for per-tag sync timestamps

**Why this approach:**
- Stashapp operations are atomic (you import/export entire markers with all tags in one GraphQL call)
- Simple transformation layer between Stashapp GraphQL types and local DB schema
- Easy to detect conflicts and track dirty state
- Rich metadata extensions don't pollute the core sync logic

#### Core Tables

}
```

### Technology Stack

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL 15+ with UUID extension
- Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
- Database migrations via Prisma Migrate

**Backend:**
- Next.js API routes for database operations
- GraphQL client for Stashapp communication (keep existing StashappService)
- Optional: Background job queue for long-running AI workflows (consider simpler polling initially)

**Frontend:**
- Keep existing Redux architecture
- Add new slices for slot management, AI results
- Enhance marker components to display slots and AI metadata

  - [X] Update markerSlice thunks to modify local DB first instead of Stashapp
  - [X] Update marker creation/update/delete to work on local DB
  - [X] **Refactor to use local database IDs throughout instead of stashappMarkerId**
    - [X] Update GET /api/markers to return internal ID as marker.id
    - [X] Update all marker operation endpoints to use internal ID
    - [X] Ensure stashappMarkerId is only used for import/export sync

- [X] Store PySceneDetect results exclusively in local DB (marker_type='shot_boundary')
- [X] Update PySceneDetect script to write to local DB via API
- [X] Build UI for viewing shot boundaries without exporting to Stashapp

#### Phase 4: Slotted Markers System (v3.0-beta.3)

**Overview**: Allow users to define performer slots for markers based on primary tags. Each slotted marker can have multiple performer slots with labels and optional gender hints.

**Terminology**:
- **Slotted Marker**: A marker with defined performer slots
- **Performer Slot**: A slot that can hold 0-1 performer
- **Slot Label**: The name/role of the slot (e.g., "Wearer", "Participant 1", "Giver", "Receiver")
- **Gender Hint**: Optional constraint on slot using Stashapp genders (MALE, FEMALE, TRANSGENDER_FEMALE, TRANSGENDER_MALE)

**Design Principles**:
- Slot definitions are configured per primary tag in Settings
- All markers with same primary tag share the same slot definitions
- Slots are optional to fill (no required slots)
- Each slot holds 0-1 performer
- For multiple performers in same role, define multiple slots with similar labels (e.g., "Participant 1", "Participant 2")
- Gender hints are advisory/filtering aids, not hard constraints
- No cardinality system needed - if multiple performers needed, just define multiple slots

**Examples**:
```typescript
// "Dress" tag with single slot
{
  primaryTag: "Dress",
  performerSlots: [
    { label: "Wearer", genderHint: "FEMALE" }
  ]
}

// "Conversation" tag with multiple slots
{
  primaryTag: "Conversation",
  performerSlots: [
    { label: "Participant 1", genderHint: null },
    { label: "Participant 2", genderHint: null },
    { label: "Participant 3", genderHint: null }
  ]
}

// Activity tag with gender hints
{
  primaryTag: "Oral",
  performerSlots: [
    { label: "Giver", genderHint: null },
    { label: "Receiver", genderHint: "MALE" }
  ]
}
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [X] Update database schema for slotted markers
  - [X] Create `slot_definitions` table with slot_label field

  - [X] Create `marker_slots` table for performer assignments
  - [X] Add markerSlots relation to Marker model
- [X] Build slot definitions CRUD API
  - [X] GET /api/slot-definitions - list all slot definitions (with optional tagId filter)
  - [X] POST /api/slot-definitions - create slot definition for a tag
  - [X] GET /api/slot-definitions/:id - get specific slot definition
  - [X] PUT /api/slot-definitions/:id - update slot definition
  - [X] DELETE /api/slot-definitions/:id - delete slot definition

  - [X] Wire up dialog save handler to update slots via API
  - [X] Refresh markers after slot updates
- [X] Polish slot system
  - [X] Make slot labels optional (some tags like "Dress" don't need labels)
  - [X] Update slot definitions in place instead of delete+recreate (preserves marker slots)
  - [X] Display fallback labels ("Slot 1", "Slot 2") when no label provided
- [ ] Remove temporary slot editing from TempMarkerForm
- [ ] Limit performers list to only show performers assigned to the scene in Stashapp

### API Design Examples

**Create marker with slots:**
```typescript
POST /api/markers
{
  "stashapp_scene_id": 123,
  "title": "Blue dress sequence",
  "start_time": 45.5,
  "end_time": 67.3,
  "marker_type": "action",
  "tags": [
    { "stashapp_tag_id": 456, "is_primary": true } // "Dress" tag
  ],
  "slots": [
    {
      "slot_definition_id": "uuid-for-wearer-slot",
      "stashapp_performer_id": 789
    }
  ],
  "exported_to_stashapp": false
}
```

**Query markers with rich filters:**
```typescript
GET /api/markers?scene_id=123&marker_type=shot_boundary&has_ai_analysis=camera_movement&movement_type=static&limit=50&offset=0
```

**Sync markers to Stashapp:**
```typescript
POST /api/sync/export-markers
{
  "marker_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2", "uuid3"],
  "sync_mode": "selective" // or "all_pending"
}
```

### Configuration Updates

**Environment variables:**
```env
# Existing Stashapp config
STASHAPP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:9999
STASHAPP_API_KEY=...

# New database config
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/stashmarker

# AI workflow config (optional)
AI_WORKFLOWS_ENABLED=true
YOLO_MODEL_PATH=/models/yolov8n.pt
CAMERA_MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD=0.1
```

### UI/UX Enhancements

**Scene Header:**
- "Import Markers from Stashapp" button
- "Export Selected to Stashapp" button
- Import/export operation status messages

**Marker List View:**
- Export status icons (✓ exported, ⚠ modified, ↻ never exported)
- Display slot summary badges (e.g., "👤 Jane Doe")
- Filter by export status
- Checkbox selection for bulk export

**Marker Detail View:**
- Slot editor panel
- AI analysis results panel (collapsible)
- Export status indicator
- "Export to Stashapp" button (exports only basic marker + tags)

**New Views:**
- Slot Definitions Manager (admin panel)
- AI Workflow Dashboard (trigger analysis, view results)
- Sync History Log (import/export operations, errors)
- Scene Browser by AI Results (e.g., "all bedroom scenes", "all static shots")

### Open Questions & Decisions Needed

1. **Import Behavior**: When importing from Stashapp, should we:
   - Skip markers already in local DB (by stashapp_marker_id)?
   - Update existing markers if Stashapp version has changed?
   - Prompt user for merge/overwrite decisions?

2. **AI Workflow Execution**: Run locally in Next.js, or separate Python service? Consider model size and performance.

3. **Slot Definition Management**: Should users define custom slots via UI, or hardcoded/config-based initially?

4. **Database Hosting**: Self-hosted PostgreSQL only, or support managed services (RDS, Supabase)?

5. **Performance Target**: How many markers per scene should we optimize for? 100? 1000? 10,000?

6. **Export Granularity**: When exporting, what gets sent to Stashapp?
   - Basic markers only (title, times, basic tags)
   - Exclude slot data, AI results (stays local)
   - How to handle markers with rich metadata on re-export?

### Breaking Changes from v2.x

- Requires PostgreSQL installation
- Requires database migration on first run
- Environment variables must include DATABASE_URL
- Markers will initially be imported from Stashapp (one-time process)
- PySceneDetect workflow changes to write to local DB instead of directly to Stashapp

### Non-Goals (Future Versions)

- Replace Stashapp entirely (remain a companion app)
- Support for non-Stashapp video sources
- Real-time collaborative marker editing (multi-user)
- Mobile app support
- Marker sharing/export to other users

---

## Implementation Notes

This is a major architectural shift. Consider:
- Create feature branch `v3-database-layer` for development
- Keep v2.x stable in main branch during development
- Regular backups during migration testing
- Performance benchmarks before and after migration
- User testing with large marker datasets (1000+ markers)

The phased approach allows shipping incremental value while building toward the full vision.
